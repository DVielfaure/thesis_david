  abstract = {Reinforcement learning has shown to be profoundly successful at learning optimal policies for simulated environments using distributed training with extensive compute capacity. Model-free reinforcement learning uses the notion of trial and error, where the error is a vital part of learning the agent to behave optimally. In mission-critical, real-world environments, there is little tolerance for failure and can cause damaging effects on humans and equipment. In these environments, current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches are not sufficient to learn optimal control policies safely. On the other hand, model-based reinforcement learning tries to encode environment transition dynamics into a predictive model. The transition dynamics describes the mapping from one state to another, conditioned on an action. If this model is accurate enough, the predictive model is sufficient to train agents for optimal behavior in real environments. This paper presents the Dreaming Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) for safely learning good policies with a significantly lower risk of catastrophes occurring during training. The algorithm combines variational autoencoders, risk-directed exploration, and curiosity to train deep-q networks inside ''dream'' states. We introduce a novel environment, ASRS-Lab, for research in the safe learning of autonomous vehicles in grid-based warehousing. The work shows that the proposed algorithm has better sample efficiency with similar performance to novel model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms while maintaining safety during training.},

While reinforcement learning is well-suited to domains with complex transition dynamics and high-dimensional state-action spaces, an additional challenge is posed by the need for safe and efficient exploration. Traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving dangerous tasks, where the trial and error process may lead to the selection of actions whose execution in some states may result in damage to the learning system (or any other system). Consequently, when an agent begins an interaction with a dangerous and high-dimensional state-action space, an important question arises; namely, that of how to avoid (or at least minimize) damage caused by the exploration of the state-action space. We introduce the PI-SRL algorithm which safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors for continuous state and action control tasks and which efficiently learns from the experience gained from the environment. We evaluate the proposed method in four complex tasks: automatic car parking, pole-balancing, helicopter hovering, and business management.},

The challenge is to flexibly control an arbitrary number of agents while achieving effective collaboration. Existing MARL methods usually suffer from the trade-off between these two considerations. To address the issue, we propose a novel architecture that learns a spatial joint representation of all the agents and outputs grid-wise actions. Each agent will be controlled independently by taking the action from the grid it occupies. By viewing the state information as a grid feature map, we employ a convolutional encoder-decoder as the policy network. This architecture naturally promotes agent communication because of the large receptive field provided by the stacked convolutional layers. Moreover, the spatially shared convolutional parameters enable fast parallel exploration that the experiences discovered by one agent can be immediately transferred to others. The proposed method can be conveniently integrated with general reinforcement learning algorithms, e.g., PPO and Q-learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extensive challenging multi-agent tasks in StarCraft II.},

The research community has been actively developing belief space planning approaches that account for the different sources of uncertainty within planning, recently also considering uncertainty in the environment observed by planning time. We further advance the state of the art by reasoning about future observations of environments that are unknown at planning time. The key idea is to incorporate within the belief indirect multi-robot constraints that correspond to these future observations. Such a formulation facilitates a framework for active collaborative state estimation while operating in unknown environments. In particular, it can be used to identify best robot actions or trajectories among given candidates generated by existing motion planning approaches, or to refine nominal trajectories into locally optimal paths using direct trajectory optimization techniques. We demonstrate our approach in a multi-robot autonomous navigation scenario and consider its applicability for autonomous navigation in unknown obstacle-free and obstacle-populated environments. Results indicate that modeling future multirobot interaction within the belief allows to determine robot actions (paths) that yield significantly improved estimation accuracy.},

  abstract = {Swarms of tiny flying robots hold great potential for exploring unknown, indoor environments. Their small size allows them to move in narrow spaces, and their light weight makes them safe for operating around humans. Until now, this task has been out of reach due to the lack of adequate navigation strategies. The absence of external infrastructure implies that any positioning attempts must be performed by the robots themselves. State-of-the-art solutions, such as simultaneous localization and mapping, are still too resource demanding. This article presents the swarm gradient bug algorithm (SGBA), a minimal navigation solution that allows a swarm of tiny flying robots to autonomously explore an unknown environment and subsequently come back to the departure point. SGBA maximizes coverage by having robots travel in different directions away from the departure point. The robots navigate the environment and deal with static obstacles on the fly by means of visual odometry and wall-following behaviors. Moreover, they communicate with each other to avoid collisions and maximize search efficiency. To come back to the departure point, the robots perform a gradient search toward a home beacon. We studied the collective aspects of SGBA, demonstrating that it allows a group of 33-g commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors to successfully explore a real-world environment. The application potential is illustrated by a proof-of-concept search-and-rescue mission in which the robots captured images to find ``victims'' in an office environment. The developed algorithms generalize to other robot types and lay the basis for tackling other similarly complex missions with robot swarms in the future. A minimal navigation solution is presented for swarms of tiny flying robots to explore unknown, GPS-denied environments.

This may mean that there are adversarial agents in the environment trying to disable the robots, or that some regions of the environment tend to make the robots fail, for example due to radiation, fire, adverse weather, or caustic chemicals. A probabilistic model of the environment is formulated, under which recursive Bayesian filters are used to estimate the environment events and hazards online. The robots must control their positions both to avoid sensor failures and to provide useful sensor information by following the analytical gradient of mutual information computed using these online estimates. Mutual information is shown to combine the competing incentives of avoiding failure and collecting informative measurements under a common objective. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.},

In the past, many approaches have used occupancy grid maps to represent the environment during the map building process. Occupancy grids, however, are based on the assumption that each cell is either occupied or free. In this paper we introduce coverage maps as an alternative way of representing the environment of a robot. Coverage maps store for each cell of a given grid a posterior about the amount the corresponding cell is covered by an obstacle. We also present a model that allows us to update coverage maps upon input obtained from proximity sensors. We furthermore describe how to use coverage maps for a decision theoretic approach to exploration. Finally we present experimental results illustrating that coverage maps can be used to efficiently learn highly accurate models even if noisy sensors such as ultrasounds are used.},

We present an analysis based on both reliability modelling and experimental trials of a case study swarm performing team work, in which failures are deliberately induced. Our case study has been carefully chosen to represent a swarm task in which the overall desired system behaviour is an emergent property of the interactions between robots, in order that we can assess the fault tolerance of a self-organising system. Our findings show that in the presence of worst-case partially failed robots the overall system reliability quickly falls with increasing swarm size. We conclude that future large scale swarm systems will need a new approach to achieving high levels of fault tolerance.},

Of our 10 grand challenges, the first 7 represent underpinning technologies that have a wider impact on all application areas of robotics. For the next two challenges, we have included social robotics and medical robotics as application-specific areas of development to highlight the substantial societal and health impacts that they will bring. Finally, the last challenge is related to responsible innovation and how ethics and security should be carefully considered as we develop the technology further. }

Different types of robots perform different tasks that are too dangerous or too dull to be done by humans. These sophisticated machines are susceptible to different types of faults. These faults have to be detected and diagnosed in time to allow recovery and continuous operation. The field of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) has been studied for many years. This research has given birth to many approaches and techniques that are applicable to different types of physical machines. Yet the domain of robotics poses unique requirements that are very challenging for traditional FDD approaches. The study of FDD for robotics is relatively new, and only few surveys were presented. These surveys have focused on traditional FDD approaches and how these approaches may broadly apply to a generic type of robot. Yet robotic systems can be identified by fundamental characteristics, which pose different constraints and requirements from FDD. In this article, we aim to provide the reader with useful insights regarding the use of FDD approaches that best suit the different characteristics of robotic systems. We elaborate on the advantages these approaches have and the challenges they must face. To meet this aim, we use two perspectives: (1) we elaborate on FDD from the perspective of the different characteristics a robotic system may have and give examples of successful FDD approaches, and (2) we elaborate on FDD from the perspective of the different FDD approaches and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each approach with respect to robotic systems. Finally, we describe research opportunities for robotic systems’ FDD. With these three contributions, readers from the FDD research communities are introduced to FDD for robotic systems, and the robotics research community is introduced to the field of FDD.}, journal = {ACM Comput.

abstract = {Swarm robotic systems are heavily inspired by observations of social insects. This often leads to robustness being viewed as an inherent property of them. However, this has been shown to not always be the case. Because of this, fault detection and diagnosis in swarm robotic systems is of the utmost importance for ensuring the continued operation and success of the swarm. This paper provides an overview of recent work in the field of exogenous fault detection and diagnosis in swarm robotics, focusing on the four areas where research is concentrated: immune system, data modelling, and blockchain-based fault detection methods and local-sensing based fault diagnosis methods. Each of these areas have significant advantages and disadvantages which are explored in detail. Though the work presented here represents a significant advancement in the field, there are still large areas that require further research. Specifically, further research is required in testing these methods on real robotic swarms, fault diagnosis methods, and integrating fault detection, diagnosis and recovery methods in order to create robust swarms that can be used for non-trivial tasks.}
